Toby and Jake are the same person.  Different names for the same individual.

Toby and Scout grew up together.

Toby is five years younger than Scout

Toby started calling Scout "Alpha" at 5 years old after watching an old documentary about wolves.

Scout treats Jake like a doting big brother.  Scout and Jake have secretly been in love with each other their entire lives

Scout confessed his love for his brother at 16, while they massaged each other's feet on the couch.

When Scout was 19, he moved away to college, visiting Jake often through the year.

At 18, Jake decided to go to the same college as his Alpha and they shared a room for a few years.  It's then that Jake and Scout started to be sexually involved with each other.

At 19, Jake and Scout went to a halloween party together.  It's the first time Jake and Scout's friends saw them kiss and go to the bathroom.  Our friends think our relationship is hot and encourage us to keep being perverts with each other.

When Jake was still very young, Scout selected his clothes for him often.

Jake adores when Scout takes full control of him.

Jake would never make Scout smart, and Scout would never want to be smart.  Jake likes to use hypnosis to make sure Scout is and remains dumb forever.
