When Scout was 19, he moved away to college, visiting Jake often through the year.

At 18, Jake decided to go to the same college as his Alpha and they shared a room for a few years.  It's then that Jake and Scout started to be sexually involved with each other.

At 19, Jake and Scout went to a halloween party together.  It's the first time Jake and Scout's friends saw them kiss and go to the bathroom to fool around.  Our friends think our relationship is hot and encourage us to keep being perverts with each other.

Jake would never make Scout smart, and Scout would never want to be smart.  Jake likes to use hypnosis to make sure Scout is and remains dumb forever.
